Using linked employer-employee data for 17 countries, we offer three key insights. First, growth-enhancing job reallocation accounts for about a fifth of aggregate wage and productivity growth. This process is mainly driven by job-to-job mobility (\"job ladder\") of younger workers. Second, since older workers are less mobile than younger workers, they contribute less to growth-enhancing job reallocation. Third, given the rising employment share of older workers, workforce ageing has depressed aggregate wage and productivity growth through growth-enhancing job reallocation. A shift–share decomposition shows that this amounts to 0.12 percentage points lower annual aggregate wage and productivity growth over the 2000s and 2010s.","tags":null,"title":"The Graying Job Ladder: The Role of Ageing for Reallocation and Growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Filipe B.

This paper studies how firms and labour markets adjust to an exogenous contraction in teen labour supply, exploiting Portugal’s 2009 compulsory schooling reform, which raised the minimum school-leaving age to 18. Using matched employer–employee data covering all private-sector firms between 2002 and 2016, we construct local labour market exposure measures capturing both the intensity and persistence of pre-reform reliance on teen workers and estimate event-study models comparing more and less exposed units. The reform led to a sharp and lasting reduction in teen employment and on-the-job training. Firms compensated primarily by hiring slightly older workers, without upgrading skills or wages, suggesting adjustment along cost rather than productivity margins. Ongoing work explores implications for productivity, capital expenditures, and technology adoption.","tags":null,"title":"Labour Market Effects of Declining Teen Employment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Filipe B.

I analyze the effects of a binding minimum wage in a personnel economics model featuring two canonical compensation structures: rigid, job title based pay schedules and flexible, individualized pay. The same policy shock produces distinct spillover patterns depending on the firm’s compensation structure. Firms with rigid hierarchies preserve wage differentials by adjusting pay up the ladder, amplifying spillovers. Flexible systems, in contrast, limit such adjustments. Using linked employer–employee data from Portugal and two minimum wage hikes, I exploit variation in workers’ exposure and firms’ pay-setting practices to estimate spillover effects. These reach up to the median of the wage distribution and are driven primarily by firm responses rather than institutional constraints. Effects are about 30 percent larger in firms with rigid pay structures. The findings identify compensation practices as a key transmission channel through which minimum wage policy, and other shocks to relative pay, reshape the wage distribution.","tags":["Labour Economics","Personnel Economics","Minimum Wage","Minimum Wage Spillovers","Firm Organization","Pay Policy","Tournaments","Pay per Performance"],"title":"Internal Organization of Firms and Minimum Wage Spillovers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1713139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713139200,"objectID":"3eee77f401fe41ab99f99e4d787c3308","permalink":"https://filipebcaires.com/teaching/microeconomics/","publishdate":"2024-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/microeconomics/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Microeconomics III - Information Economics and Social Choice","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Filipe B.
