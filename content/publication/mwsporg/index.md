abstract: This paper provides empirical evidence that firms' internal organization and associated pay policies shape the propagation of minimum wage spillovers. Rigid, tournament-like firms use between-level pay differentials to incentivize workers and respond to minimum wage hikes by raising wages up the hierarchy, amplifying spillovers.  Flexible firms rely more on individual wage-setting and can limit spillovers. I study these mechanisms through a simple model of firm organization and pay policies. Using rich administrative employer-employee data from Portugal, I study two minimum wage hikes and construct measures of firm rigidity to examine how organizational structure shapes the strength of spillovers. Spillovers from the minimum wage reach the 47$^{th}$ percentile of the wage distribution, and represent around 40\% of the direct effect on minimum wage workers. I show that spillovers are up to 40\% stronger in rigid firms, with well-defined hierarchies and structured pay policies. These findings have broader implications for a wide range of shocks that shift relative pay within firms.

summary: <u>Draft Available Upon Request.</u>  <br><br> This paper provides empirical evidence that firms' internal organization and associated pay policies shape the propagation of minimum wage spillovers. Rigid, tournament-like firms use between-level pay differentials to incentivize workers. They respond to minimum wage hikes by raising wages up the hierarchy, amplifying spillovers to a larger extent than flexible firms, where wage-setting has a stronger individual component. I rationalize the mechanism throguh a simple theoretical model.
