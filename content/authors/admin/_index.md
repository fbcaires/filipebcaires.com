I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics), in Florence, Italy. In my research, I apply microeconometric methods to study policy-relevant questions in labour and public economics. I work under the supervision of [Andrea Ichino](https://andreaichino.it) and [Thomas Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/). I'm also a Research Affiliate at [HEC Montréal](https://www.hec.ca/en/iea/index.html) and [Università Bocconi](https://economics.unibocconi.eu/).

During my PhD, I undertook research visits at [HEC Montréal](https://www.hec.ca/en/iea/index.html) and the [Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan](https://isr.umich.edu/), and served as an economist at the Directorate for Employment, Labour, and Social Affairs at the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en.html) for half a year. I am a member of the [LinkEED 2.0](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/projects/linkeed-200.html) research network.
