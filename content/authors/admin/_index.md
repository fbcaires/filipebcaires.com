I am a third year PhD candidate in Economics at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics), in Florence, Italy. In my research, I apply microeconometric methods to study policy-relevant questions. My main interests are in labour and public economics. 

I work under the supervision of [Andrea Ichino](https://andreaichino.it) and [Thomas Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/).

Upcoming Talks:
