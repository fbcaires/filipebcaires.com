abstract: This paper analyses how workforce ageing has tended to slow aggregate wage and productivity growth by dampening growth-enhancing job reallocation. Using linked employer-employee data for 17 countries, we offer three key insights. First, growth-enhancing job reallocation accounts for about a fifth of aggregate wage and productivity growth. This process is mainly driven by job-to-job mobility ("job ladder") of younger workers. Second, since older workers are less mobile than younger workers, they contribute less to growth-enhancing job reallocation. Third, given the rising employment share of older workers, workforce ageing has depressed aggregate wage and productivity growth through growth-enhancing job reallocation. A shift–share decomposition shows that this amounts to 0.12 percentage points lower annual aggregate wage and productivity growth over the 2000s and 2010s.

Second, since older workers are less mobile than younger workers, they contribute less to growth-enhancing job reallocation. Third, given the rising employment share of older workers, workforce ageing has depressed aggregate wage and productivity growth through growth-enhancing job reallocation. A shift–share decomposition shows that this amounts to 0.12 percentage points lower annual aggregate wage and productivity growth over the 2000s and 2010s.
