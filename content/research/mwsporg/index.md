  This paper provides empirical evidence that firms’ internal organization and pay-setting
  practices shape how minimum wage shocks propagate through the wage distribution. I analyze
  the effects of a binding minimum wage in a personnel economics model featuring two canonical
  compensation structures: rigid, job title based pay schedules and flexible, individualized pay.
  The same policy shock produces distinct spillover patterns depending on the firm’s compensation
  structure. Firms with rigid hierarchies preserve wage differentials by adjusting pay up the ladder,
  amplifying spillovers. Flexible systems, in contrast, limit such adjustments. Using linked
  employer–employee data from Portugal and two minimum wage hikes, I exploit variation in workers’
  exposure and firms’ pay-setting practices to estimate spillover effects. These reach up to the
  median of the wage distribution and are driven primarily by firm responses rather than institutional
  constraints. Effects are about 30 percent larger in firms with rigid pay structures. The findings
  identify compensation practices as a key transmission channel through which minimum wage policy,
  and other shocks to relative pay, reshape the wage distribution.
